## Core Java Class

### `ResizeGUI.java`
Implements a graphical user interface using Swing:
- Initializes a default window (400x300) with two input panels—one for width and one for height.
- Each panel includes a text field and a submit button that updates the window size in real time.
- After resizing, the window is automatically re-centered on the screen using `frame.setLocationRelativeTo(null)`.
- Uses `GridLayout` for clean and structured component layout.

2. Navigate to `ResizeGUI.java`.
3. Click **Run** on the main method to launch the GUI.

## Future Enhancements
- Combine width and height inputs into a single submission for convenience.
- Add input validation to prevent non-numeric entries or extreme values.
- Provide visual feedback or status messages upon resizing.
- Enable preset resolution buttons (e.g., 800x600, 1024x768).
- Implement a reset button to return to default dimensions.
