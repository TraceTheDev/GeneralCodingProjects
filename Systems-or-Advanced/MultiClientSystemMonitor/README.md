# ClientServerMonitor

A concise Java console application demonstrating basic client-server networking using sockets, where an iterative server responds to system-level requests and a multithreaded client issues concurrent queries to measure turnaround performance.

## Core Java Classes

### `IterativeServer.java`
Implements a simple iterative TCP server:
- Listens on port `1234` and handles one client connection at a time.
- Accepts plain-text commands such as `date and time`, `uptime`, `memory use`, `netstat`, `current users`, and `running processes`.
- Executes each command using system-level operations and returns the result to the client.
- Uses standard Java networking and I/O classes to manage connections and responses.

### `MultiThreadedClient.java`
Implements a multithreaded TCP client:
- Prompts the user for the server IP, port number, command to send, and number of client requests to generate.
- Creates multiple threads where each thread connects to the server, sends the command, receives the response, and prints it.
- Tracks and calculates the total and average turnaround time for all requests to assess performance under load.

## How to Run

### From an IDE
1. Open the project folder.
2. Run `IterativeServer.java` first to start the server.
3. Then run `MultiThreadedClient.java` to initiate client requests.

### From the command line
**In one terminal window (start the server):**
```bash
javac src/IterativeServer.java -d out
java -cp out IterativeServer
```

**In a separate terminal window (run the client):**
```bash
javac src/MultiThreadedClient.java -d out
java -cp out MultiThreadedClient
```

> ðŸ”¹ Make sure both are using the same port (default is 1234).

## Future Enhancements
- Convert the server to a fully multithreaded model for handling concurrent connections.
- Add logging for all client requests and server responses.
- Include error recovery and retry logic for failed connections.
- Build a GUI using Swing or JavaFX for real-time monitoring and control.
