# DiceTotal

A simple Java-based dice-rolling application built with object-oriented design principles.  
This project demonstrates clean code structure and deterministic pseudo-randomness—ideal for educational or personal study tools.

## Core Java Classes

### `GVDie.java`
Represents a single six-sided die containing:
- `myValue`: The current face value (1-6)  
- `rand`: A `java.util.Random` instance for generating rolls  

### `RollDice.java`
Drives the application:
- Prompts the user for the number of rolls  
- Seeds a `GVDie` with **15** for repeatable output  
- Rolls the die the requested number of times  
- Prints the summed total of all rolls

## Future Enhancements
- Persistent storage (file or database) to save roll histories  
- More interactive GUI using JavaFX or Swing
