## Core Java Classes

### `Instrument.java`
Represents a generic musical instrument:
- `instrumentName`: Name of the instrument (e.g., “Piano”)
- `instrumentManufacturer`: Manufacturer or brand
- `yearBuilt`: The year the instrument was made
- `cost`: Price of the instrument
- Standard setters/getters for all fields
- `printInfo()`: Outputs a formatted “Instrument Information” block

### `StringInstrument.java`
Extends `Instrument` to model string-based instruments:
- Adds `numStrings` and `numFrets` as private fields
- Provides setters/getters for the new fields

### `InstrumentInformation.java`
Acts as the program driver:
- Prompts the user for general and string instrument details
- Instantiates `Instrument` and `StringInstrument` objects with the input
- Prints the general instrument block, then the string instrument block with extra details

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for other instrument categories (e.g., wind, percussion)
- Persist instrument data to a file or database
- Include a GUI (Swing or JavaFX) for a more interactive experience
