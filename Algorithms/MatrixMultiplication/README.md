## Core Java Class

### `MatrixMultiplication.java`
Executes vector-matrix multiplication:
- Prompts the user for the size `n`, a 1D vector of length `n`, and an `n × n` matrix
- Computes the resulting 1D vector using dot-product logic
- Prints the resulting vector as the output of multiplying `A × B`

**Key Concepts:**
- Uses nested loops for input and calculation
- Demonstrates use of 1D and 2D arrays
- Handles clean console interaction with guided prompts
